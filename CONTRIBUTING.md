### Your first contribution

If you are unsure where to start, you can look through issues tagged with `beginner` and `help wanted`:
- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/fsimphy/bayernfahrplan/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22beginner%22) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/fsimphy/bayernfahrplan/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Pull requests

#### Branching model

We use a very simple branching model: The `master` branch always contains the most recent development version and releases are created by tagging. Changes are developed in feature branches and all merges are required to be done as pull requests. We also have a naming scheme for our feature branches:
```
<scope>[-<issue_number>]_short-description
```
Scope can be one of the following:
- `feature` - new features and enhancements to extisting features
- `bugfix` - bugfixes (obviously)
- `technical` - changes of the code that do not modify featues (e.g. refactoring, adding tests, updating dependencies etc.)
- `chore` - everything that does not touch the actual code (modifying README files, renaming files etc.)

The issue number is optional as changes that are not related to an issue are allowed. However, if a change is related to an issue, the issue number must be given.

#### Submitting pull requests

When creating a pull request, please provide the following information by filling in the [template](.github/pull_request_template.md).

- What issue does this pull request correspond to (if any)?
- What does this pull request implement?
- What changes are made in this pull request?

## Styleguides

### Git commit messages
Git commit messages must have the following format:
```
<scope>: short description
optionally some more descriptions in the following lines
```
Scope can be one of the following:
- `fix` - bugfixes
- `feat` - completed features
- `wip` - work in progress
- `test` - everything related to tests
- `refactor` - refactoring
- `technical` - everything else that is `technical` and does not belong to `test` or `refactor`
- `chore` - everything not touching the actual code

For the actual text in the commit message, here are some additional guidelines:

- Use the present tense ("add feature" not "added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("move cursor to…" not "moves cursor to…").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### D Styleguide
All D code must adhere to [The D Style](https://dlang.org/dstyle.html). We suggest using [dfmt](https://github.com/dlang-community/dfmt) to format the code accordingly.

### Imports

All imports should be selective, except for module-level imports using more than three specific import. These should import the whole corresponding module.
Each symbol should only be imported once, and with a scope as small as possible (i.e. function/scope level imports are preferred over module-level imports).

## Additional notes

### Issue labels

We use issue labels to categorize issues into groups. This makes finding issues belonging to a particular group very easy. 
Our tagging system is loosly based on Zach Dunn’s [Styleguide for issue tagging](https://robinpowered.com/blog/best-practice-system-for-organizing-and-tagging-github-issues/). Here is a list of all labels we currently use:

| Label name     | Description                                                                                      |
